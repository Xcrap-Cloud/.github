Xcrap Cloud is an ambitious Web Scraping project that seeks to solve architectural problems in web scrapers and crawlers. Our main stack is composed of TypeScript and Node.js.

This project also has a SaaS platform called **[Xcrap Cloud](https://xcrap.cloud)**, where we enable our users to create scrapers by defining analysis and transformation models that serve to extract and transform data. We offer this service via website and REST API.

All our projects are open source and licensed under the MIT license, contribute with us!
